## SciPY Installation Instructions
  To install SciPY, you must follow these steps:
  1) Command: initiate the installation process (usually downloads its dependencies)
        !pip install scipy

  2) Depending on the system and configurations, it may be needed to install the additional libraries (NumPy & Matplotlib)
        !pip install numpy matplotlib

  3) Once installations are complete, we import the library, and therefore verifying everything it was properly downloaded
        import scipy

  4) If there are no errors, SciPy is ready to be used

## Library overview (SciPY) Overview
  SciPy is an open-source library for mathematics, science, and engineering that was built on top of NumPy. It provides additional functionality, as it provides tools for a wide range of applications.
  SciPy was designed to be a powerful and efficient toolkit for scientific computing tasks, and it includes modules for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, signal and image processing, statistics, and others.
  Data Scientists often use SciPy to perform complex numerical operations and analyses efficiently, we can deep dive in the following:

  Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, and probability distributions
  Optimization: Fine-tune parameters and optimize functions
  Signal and Image Processing: Filtering, convolution, Fourier analysis, and other
  Numerical Integration: Computing definite integrals (common in scientific simulations)
  Linear Algebra: matrix operations (relevant to data analysis)
  Machine Learning:  optimization and linear algebra modules are crucial components
